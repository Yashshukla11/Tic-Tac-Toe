<b><u><h1>Tic-Tac-Toe</h1></u></b>

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game made using Python programming language. The game requires two players to take turns marking a 3x3 grid with X or O until one player successfully fills three squares in a row either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The game starts by asking for the names of the two players and displaying an empty 3x3 grid. The program then takes input from the players and marks the chosen square with the player's symbol. It then checks if either player has won, if the game has ended in a tie or if the game is still ongoing. If either player wins, the program displays the winner's name. If the game ends in a tie, the program displays a message indicating that it's a tie. The flow chart of this program includes the start of the game, displaying the empty grid, taking input from players, marking squares, checking if either player has won, if the game is still ongoing or if it's a tie, and displaying the winner or tie message. The game will continue until one player wins or the game ends in a tie.
